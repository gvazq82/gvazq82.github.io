    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Migrate an existent Browserify application to Webpack 2.0.

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Have a new version of the previous Browserify application running now with Webpack 2.0.</p>

    <h3>Migration Process</h3>
    <p>
      I want to migrate a bigger application at work that currently is using Browserify and use instead Webpack 2.0
      but first I would like to start with this small sandbox to understand the required effort to migrate and
      possible error during the migration.
    </p>
    <p>
      First I created another repository in GitHub to migrate the application.
    </p>
    {% highlight bash %}
mkdir backbone-webpack
git init
git add .
git commit "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/gvazq82/backbone-webpack.git
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      I copied almost entirely my previous <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gvazq82/backbone-browserify">backbone-browserify</a>
      application structure to the new project, including:
      <ul>
        <li>index.html</li>
        <li>/src/*.*</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of copying the previous <b>package.json</b> decided to start from a new configuration leaving the defaults.
    </p>
    {% highlight bash %}
    npm init
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      Installed Webpack and previous project dependencies.
    </p>
    {% highlight bash %}
npm install --save-dev webpack
npm install --save-dev bootstrap-sass
npm install backbone bootstrap jquery underscore
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      Created a <b>webpack.config.js</b> file that should include the following project configuration.
    </p>
    {% highlight javascript linenos %}
var path = require('path');
  
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      It could be possible to execute Webpack directly from command line, but instead I would like to define a package
      script to run the build.
      {% highlight json linenos %}
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
}
      {% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The complete process of migrating the AMD application to Browserify took me around 4 hours since I am already using
      it at work, the most important challenges I found was to be able to continue using a dynamic approach to execute the
      controllers and keep away of a more advance build tool like grunt or gulp using just node scripts.
      
      At this time it is still pending the migration of the tests.
