		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>According to the Backbone Documentation "Backbone should
			continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full
			experience of your web application", this leaves so many options for
			the developers to define their own implementation for the
			application, leaving the architecture decisions be defined according
			to the developer expertise. This flexibility allows to create great
			variety of implementations but also open the window to have poor and
			not scalable applications.</p>

		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>Create a scalable single page application using Backbone JS,
			Underscore JS, Require JS and Bootstrap applying the MVC pattern.</p>
	</section>

		<h3>Implementation</h3>
		<p>Backbone is more a Model View Model (MVM) "framework" instead of
			Model View Controller (MVC). This is because does not provide a
			"Controller" component by default.</p>
		<p>There are some many discussions about what a "Controller"
			should be and if this is not already cover by the Router, in my opinion the Router has 
			a very specific function listening for the changes on the URL, but there
			is not component who actually is just responsible to integrate multiple views and make them work together, this is 
			the 'Controller'.
		</p>
		<p>	
			For this example, I integrated a custom component called "Controller"
			who is the responsible to encapsulate chunks of functionality wrapping different "Views" in a single component and 
			handling the interactions between them.
			<br><br>
		The "Controller" is just an object with a common signature that includes the methods:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>init:</strong> Called at the beginning, before the
				controller is executed to setup variables or the layout for the
				component.</li>
			<li><strong>run:</strong> It is the main method of execution who
				receives the data and region where the component needs to be
				displayed. It is important to allow the component be reused.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Each controller is been executed for the function <strong>ExecuteController</strong>
		that is the responsible to provide the "Data" and "Region" the
		controller could use to render the content.
		</p>
		<h4>Layouts</h4>
		<p>
		Other key component in the implementation is the use of the Layout, who is the responsible to 
		render the views in a specific section and avoid <a target="_blank" href="https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps/">Zombies</a> 
		views effects making sure the section 
		is cleaned and the events are unbind on the view destruction.
		</p>
		<h4>Exceptions</h4>
		<p>
		As each controller is responsible just for specific functionality to be render in a specific section, 
		if there is any issue while processing the component, it is possible to display an error just in that section, not affecting
		all functionality.
