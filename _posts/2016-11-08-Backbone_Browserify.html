    <h3>Migration Process</h3>
    <p>
      Here is my journey to migrate an existent AMD application to Browserify since I wanted to start using different
      frameworks with the initial problem I wanted to solve with my AMD application.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Create a new project with similar structure including a <strong>package.json</strong> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Install the required <strong>dependencies</strong> for my project:
      <ul>
        <li>backbone</li>
        <li>underscore</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
      </ul>
      And the following <strong>dev dependencies</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>bootstrapSass</li>
        <li>browserify</li>
        <li>jasmine</li>
        <li>jstify</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Replace all the RequireJS packages By CommonJS packages like this:
{% highlight javascript %}
define(['backbone'], function(Backbone) {
  return {};
});
{% endhighlight %}
    
{% highlight javascript %}
var Backbone = require('backbone');
module.exports = {};
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Create a <strong>main.js</strong> file responsible to include all dependencies and some setup required to work
      with Backbone/JQuery.
{% highlight javascript %}
var Backbone = require('backbone');
var $ = require('jquery');
Backbone.$ = $;
{% endhighlight %}
      This file is also required to start the execution of my application using the previously created function
      <strong>App.Start()</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. For the AMD application it was possible to load the controllers on demand, passed as configuration, but since
      browserify is not packaging any dependency that is explicitly required in the code, it is not going to work with
      the dynamic approach previously defined. Instead, it is required to define all my controllers in a file to be able
      to continue using my dynamic approach:
{% highlight javascript%}
// Need to require the controllers
require('../app/controllers/about');
require('../app/controllers/contact');
require('../app/controllers/exception');
require('../app/controllers/home');
{% endhighlight%}
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Include bootstrap SASS to be ready in the future to integrate additional styles and also to have more freedom
      about the final bundle.css file generated and destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Create the required node scripts to build the components for the application.
{% highlight javascript%}
"scripts": {
  "create-dist": "mkdir -p dist",
  "clean-dist": "rm -rf dist",
  "copy-fonts": "cp -R node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/ dist/fonts",
  "build-js": "browserify src/app.js > dist/bundle.js",
  "build-css": "node-sass src/main.scss dist/css/bundle.css",
  "build": "npm run clean-dist && npm run create-dist && npm run build-js && npm run build-css && npm run copy-fonts"
}
{% endhighlight%}
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      The complete process of migrating the AMD application to Browserify took me around 4 hours since I am already using
      it at work, the most important challenges I found was to be able to continue using a dynamic approach to execute the
      controllers and keep away of a more advance build tool like grunt or gulp using just node scripts.
      
      At this time it is still pending the migration of the tests.
